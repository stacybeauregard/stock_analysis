# stock_analysis
## Overview of Project

Steve needs to analyze the data of the entire stock market now for his parents, not just a few specific stocks. To be able to do so, the original code needs to be refactored to hopefully run more efficiently for the thousands of stocks.

### Results

Comparing the stock years 2017 and 2018; 2017 was significantly better for stockholders as all stocks had a positive return percentage of at least 92.8. Unfortunately in 2018 stocks didn't fair so well and the majority had a loss.

Refactoring the code was only milliseconds faster for our data, but with the entire stock market to be analyzed this should help Steve significantly save time.

### Summary

Refactoring code to be more precise reduces the amount of time spent waiting for the code to run and increases efficiency of the code however there is an increase in the amount of time spent writing code to make it run faster. More time is spent testing the new, longer code but it should pay off in the long run for Steve to do his full stock analysis.
